# Python-Data-Visualization-Election-Analysis

This Python Notebook consists of the Data Visualization of the Polls and Donors Data Set for the 2012 Election of Obama and Mitt Romney.
The Donor Data set can be found here : https://www.dropbox.com/s/l29oppon2veaq4n/Election_Donor_Data.csv?dl=0


In this project we will analyze two datasets. The first data set will be the results of political polls. We will analyze this aggregated poll data and answer some questions:

1.) Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?

2.) Did the poll results favor Romney or Obama?

3.) How do undecided voters effect the poll?

4.) Can we account for the undecided voters?

5.) How did voter sentiment change over time?

6.) Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?

Next, we will look at the Donor Data set and answer some of the below questons:

1.) How much was donated and what was the average donation?

2.) How did the donations differ between candidates?

3.) How did the donations differ between Democrats and Republicans?

4.) What were the demographics of the donors?

5.) Is there a pattern to donation amounts?
